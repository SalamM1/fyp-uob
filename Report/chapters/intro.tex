\section{Info}
	Emotion recognition from speech is important with tasks involving Human-Machine interaction in the same way it is important to Human-Human interaction. The main issues in this field are related to the search for highly discriminate features and appropriate classification methods.

\section{Objective}
	Conduct an appropriate literature review regarding relevant topics, primarily Emotion Recognition and Speech Signal Processing, that use more recent techniques, such as GMM-UBMs and Deep Neural Networks.
	
	Apply signal processing techniques to Emotional Speech Data commonly used in Speaker Identity Verification
	
	Used a DNN classifier to obtain a baseline performance for such techniques.
